# Shortcut Matching Godot Game

This is a keyboard shortcut matching game around JetBrains IDE shortucts
in which the shortcuts spawn randomly and drop from the top of the screen. To
score, you need to hit the keys on the tiles.

# Note

Shortcuts right now are for MacOS, so you may need to adjust the collection
of shortcuts to suite your operating system. The shortcuts are in
[scenes/Game.gd](/scenes/Game.gd#L16).
